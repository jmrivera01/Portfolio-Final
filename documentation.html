                So, I am starting fresh from the start with the project. I have a couple of ideas that I was to implement like a nice background and stuff. I need to read more, but I think it’s going to turn out nicely. The idea is to make an appealing UI so that the user can have a great casino experience. I’m trying to combine different elements to make it more appealing for the eye.

                I am having issues with the background image I want to use. I can't seem to expand it correctly. I tried messing around with the height and width. First, I had problems detecting the image for the background using the URL keyword. To fix that I went to stackoverflow.com and w3 schools. As expected, there were a couple of people experiencing the same issue. The first suggestion was that the URL must be in a certain format, and I applied it to my website. After the change the website could now detect the image, so I utilize my googling skills.             </div>

                The background image was not fully covering the whole background of the website and that bothered me a little. So, I played with the height and width parameters for a long while and I concluded that using 100vh for the height and 210hv for the width. This was the best solution I could come up with because now the image covers the space correctly. It took a while, but it works correctly. It even stays the same way if you zoom in or/and out!            </div>

                I was trying to recreate the console window that Will's project has. I tried to make a white box in which we can display the game information. At first it was tricky because the white box would not show the correct text. After looking in stackoveflow.com I found a solution which involved using query selector and class selectors. Using the selected elements, I played around with the HTML attributes. After experimenting wit it, I found that using innerText attributes to be most useful for the problem.            </div>

                For the score board UI, I began investigating Will’s example. I found that initially I could just make a single box with the text spread across the box. However, I was not satisfied with that solution as java would be later impossible to adjust the score board’s elements such balance or turn. I made a separate div for each score board item that I would need to modify such as balance, turn, bet and current point. In the end that was the most practical solution found because the elements were placed nicely and were ready to be used later on in the project. However, I would still need to properly place them on the screen.            </div>

                In order to properly adjust the score board position. I had to experiment with different position attributes HTML has to offer such as relative, sticky, absolute and many more. After messing around with it, I decided to stick with absolute position as it nicely aligns with the desired goal in mind for the website. In the end I got working four separate div elements. One was for the balance and the other ones like current point, bet and turn. Most importantly all those div elements were extremely professionally place into the website.            </div>

                I was experimenting with this website using my phone to ensure that all of the UI/GUI looks good on the on it as well to have a website that adapts to all screen sizes. I noticed that the UI was worse on my phone than on my laptop. To fix that issue, I consulted stackoverflow and w3schools after deliberately researching, I found that instead of using pixels, I used the more recommended measuring units such as percentages.            </div>

                Now I wanted to see how much I can break the website with the controls you were giving as a phone user. I did not impose limitations on to computer website users since I could not break the website with neither my laptop nor my PC. Regardless, with the phone I could zoom out infinitely to the point the UI became unreadable and interactable. In order to fix that, I consulted Google and I decided to stick with the solution that involved disabling zoom in and out. After that, the UI worked in all sizes.             </div>

                The very tricky part about the UI/GUI which involved making buttons for the user and appealing to the eye. I decided to use the button layout that was used in my homepage since I really like the style it had. I decided to put all the buttons under the white box window because that looked very nice and it followed Will’s instructions. However, I did decide to set the reset button on the bottom So the user doesn’t hit the reset button by mistake. In the end, I finally positioned correctly and very readable and appealing to the eye.            </div>

                I wanted to also make my buttons differently colored to make it more appealing. For example, setting the minus button to red and the plus button was set to green. I decided to make ‘restart’ button blue to highlight its significance and meaning. I decided to make ‘roll’ and ‘bet’ buttons yellow to represent them nicely and make them a color between red and green (plus and minus). In the end, we got a very appealing UI with each with each button having separate meaning and individuality. I also made a hover effect for the buttons for when the user places the cursor on top of the button itself. I also had some issues with the positioning of the buttons at first, but I managed to fix it after some tinkering.             </div>

                I am having issues with the background of the crap’s table. The image did not want to size up to the size that I wanted. For some reason the background would shrink instead of staying in place. I had to look up on Google and found solution using the -z parameter. After much tinkering, I finally managed to make it stay in place and the correct image size.            </div>

                In the end the project turned out to be a success! I clicked all the buttons and links to make sure that they all worked properly. All the elements were correctly in place. Even though it took me a long time to accomplish, I managed to make It look good and appealing to the eye. The score board placing also gave me a bit of trouble, but I managed to place it finally in its correct place! Overall I am content with my project’s outcome and after lots of work everything is running smoothly.            </div>
